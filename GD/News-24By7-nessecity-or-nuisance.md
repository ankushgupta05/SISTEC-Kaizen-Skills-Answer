🎙 GD Topic: 24/7 News Channel – Necessity or Nuisance

👉 Focus: Mostly a Nuisance in Today’s Time


---

🔹 Introduction (Start Strongly):

Good morning friends,

In my opinion, today’s 24/7 news channels are becoming more of a nuisance than a necessity.

Instead of giving real and helpful news, many channels are now focusing only on TRP (Television Rating Points), drama, and fake headlines.
Let me explain why I feel this.


---

❌ Why Today’s News Channels Are Mostly Wrong (With Real Examples):

1. Media Trial in Sushant Singh Rajput Case (2020)

After the actor died, channels like Republic TV and others blamed Rhea Chakraborty 24x7, without proof.
She was later found not guilty by CBI.
👉 But media destroyed her image, called her a criminal on TV every day.

🗣 “News channels should report the truth, not act like judges.”


---

2. Fake News During COVID-19 (2020–21)

Some channels said cow urine can cure corona.
Some promoted untested medicines.
People got scared and confused.

👉 WHO and Indian Government had to stop these fake messages.

🗣 “In a health crisis, wrong news can kill. News channels should be more responsible.”


---

3. Loud and Fake Debates

Today, debates on news channels are full of shouting and personal attacks.
No one listens, no facts, only drama.

🗣 “This is not journalism — this is entertainment in the name of news.”


---

4. Too Much Negative News

Channels show only crime, rape, violence, hatred — day and night.
People feel fear, anger, and stress.
Children also watch such news and feel unsafe.

🗣 “News should inform and uplift people — not spread fear every hour.”


---

5. Paid News and Bias

Some channels support political parties and hide truth.
They show only one side of the story.
This is not free journalism — this is sold journalism.

🗣 “Media is supposed to speak truth to power, not work for power.”


---

🔸 Yes, Sometimes News Helps – But Very Rarely Now

✅ Example: In the Odisha train accident (2023), news helped rescue teams reach faster.
✅ Example: Chandrayaan-3’s moon landing was shown live and united the country.

🗣 “But these good examples are now very rare. Mostly, we see noise, not news.”


---

🔚 Conclusion (Strong Finish):

So friends, I believe 24/7 news channels are not doing their job honestly anymore.
They are not informing us, they are influencing us — and mostly in the wrong way.

👉 News should be based on facts, not shouting.
👉 Media should ask questions, not spread hate.
👉 Until then, I don’t support 24/7 news in its current form.

Thank you.

✅ Bonus Line You Can Say to Impress:

> “We don’t need 24 hours of drama — we need 10 minutes of honest journalism.”

🎙 GD Topic: 24/7 News Channel – Necessity or Nuisance

(Simple English | Spoken format | Easy flow)


---

🔹 Introduction (Start confidently):

Good morning friends.

I think 24/7 news channels are both useful and harmful.
They give fast news, but also spread too much drama.

Let me explain the good and bad sides.


---

✅ Why 24/7 News is Good (Necessity):

1. Fast Information:
In big events like elections, disasters, or accidents — news comes quickly.
Example: During COVID-19, news channels gave vaccine and safety info.


2. Awareness:
People in villages also get to know about government schemes, health tips, and national events.


3. Democracy:
News shows problems in the country and asks questions to the government. This is important.




---

❌ Why 24/7 News is Harmful (Nuisance):

1. Too Much Drama:
Many channels shout and fight just to get TRP. It’s like a TV show, not real news.


2. Fake News:
In the race to be first, they sometimes show wrong or unverified news.


3. Biased Channels:
Some news channels support political parties and do not show the full truth.


4. Mental Stress:
Watching negative news all the time makes people scared, sad, or angry.




---

🔸 Smart Point (Balance the view):

The problem is not 24/7 news itself — the real problem is how they show it.

If they follow truth, facts, and ethics — they can really help the country.


---

🔚 Conclusion (End clearly):

So, I feel 24/7 news is useful only if it is honest and responsible.

If it spreads lies or fear, then it is harmful.

We don’t need more noise — we need better news.

Thank you.
