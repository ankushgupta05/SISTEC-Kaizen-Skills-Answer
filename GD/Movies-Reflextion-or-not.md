✅ Opening (conversational)
Good morning everyone. I’m really happy to be part of this discussion today. Our topic is "Are movies a reflection of society?" — and I think it’s something we can all relate to.



✅ Points in favor (yes)
First of all, many movies are inspired by real-life events and social issues. For example, movies like Article 15 or Pink talk about discrimination and women’s safety, which are real problems in our society.

Also, regional films often show our traditions, family systems, and cultural values — they help us understand different lifestyles across the country.

Biopics and movies based on true stories also show how people struggle and succeed in real life. So in many cases, movies do act like a mirror, showing us both good and bad sides of society.
