Here’s the Interview Question + Simple Answer version, in a natural storytelling style:

Q: Share a special childhood moment.

A:
"When I was very small, I lived with my grandmother in a small village called Ranipur, Gorakhpur, UP. I studied in a local school there. Our teacher had very little hair, so everyone called him Ganja Sir. He was very strict and used to beat children with a thick green bamboo stick. Children cried even before getting beaten.

When my turn came, he used to say in Bhojpuri:
‘Aur Gupta ji, abhi tak 1 se 10 tak ginti par hi atke ho?’

At that time, I didn’t even know counting properly, so I got beaten many times. Later, when I moved to Bhopal, till 5th class I had no interest in studies. But from 6th class something changed. I started studying well, and in 10th I scored 83%, in 12th I got 81%.

This is my small childhood memory."

👉 Do you want me to make an even shorter version (2–3 lines) for quick interviews, or keep this detailed one?
