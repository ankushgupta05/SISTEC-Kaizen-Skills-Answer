✅ **4) What are your weaknesses?**

A while ago, when I was in my first year of college, my communication skills were not very good. Because of that, I used to feel nervous and avoided going on stage in front of a large audience.

But with time, I started focusing on improving myself. Someone once gave me very useful advice — they said, “Whatever you think or say in your daily life, try to say it in English.” I started following this advice regularly.

By practicing daily and working hard, I slowly improved my communication skills. Now I feel much more confident when speaking in English or in front of people.

Also, I sometimes spend extra time perfecting small details, which can slow me down. I’m learning to manage my time better by setting clear goals and priorities. I believe weaknesses can become strengths when we keep improving ourselves.

### ** 5) Question:**

**Can you describe a challenging situation you faced at work and how you handled it?**

---

### **Answer (Easy Version):**

One challenging situation I faced was in my **4th semester** of B.Tech when we had to make our **first minor project**. It was compulsory for every student. Our faculty, **Ms. Ruchi Jain**, divided all students into groups and chose one **team leader** for each group. She also made sure that no friends were in the same team.

I was selected as the **team leader**, and it was my first time leading a team. I was a little scared but also excited. First, I talked with my team members to know what skills they had and what they could do best. I also created a **WhatsApp group** so we could discuss everything easily.

After that, we decided to make a project called **“Eye Disease Classification System.”** It was an app that could identify eye diseases like **Cataract**, **Diabetic Retinopathy**, and **Normal Eye Health** using **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** technology.

I divided the work among all team members — some worked on documentation, some on backend and frontend, and I worked mostly on the technical part. We all worked hard and completed the project successfully.

From this project, I learned how to **lead a team**, **communicate better**, and **manage work under pressure**. It also gave me confidence that any challenge can be solved with teamwork and patience.





That’s a really **heartfelt and meaningful answer**, Ankush 💫
