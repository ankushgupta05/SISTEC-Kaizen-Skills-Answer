Great question! Let’s discuss these one by one clearly. You also asked for explanation about **why** we choose each option, **when** we use which rules, and general rules for changing **direct speech to indirect speech**.

# 💬 **General Rules for Direct to Indirect Speech**

✅ **Pronoun change**

* First person pronouns (I, we) change according to the subject of reporting verb.
* Second person pronouns (you) change according to the object of reporting verb.
* Third person pronouns (he, she, they) usually remain the same.

✅ **Tense change**

* If the reporting verb is in past tense, the verb in reported speech generally changes back (present → past, present continuous → past continuous, etc.).
* No change if reporting verb is in present or future tense.

✅ **Words showing nearness change to farness**

* this → that
* these → those
* here → there
* now → then
* today → that day
* tomorrow → next day
* yesterday → previous day

✅ **Remove quotation marks and use conjunction (that, if, whether, why, etc.)**
