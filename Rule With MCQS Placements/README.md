Great question! Let‚Äôs discuss these one by one clearly. You also asked for explanation about **why** we choose each option, **when** we use which rules, and general rules for changing **direct speech to indirect speech**.

# üí¨ **General Rules for Direct to Indirect Speech**

‚úÖ **Pronoun change**

* First person pronouns (I, we) change according to the subject of reporting verb.
* Second person pronouns (you) change according to the object of reporting verb.
* Third person pronouns (he, she, they) usually remain the same.

‚úÖ **Tense change**

* If the reporting verb is in past tense, the verb in reported speech generally changes back (present ‚Üí past, present continuous ‚Üí past continuous, etc.).
* No change if reporting verb is in present or future tense.

‚úÖ **Words showing nearness change to farness**

* this ‚Üí that
* these ‚Üí those
* here ‚Üí there
* now ‚Üí then
* today ‚Üí that day
* tomorrow ‚Üí next day
* yesterday ‚Üí previous day

‚úÖ **Remove quotation marks and use conjunction (that, if, whether, why, etc.)**
