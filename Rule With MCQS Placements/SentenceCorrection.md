Here’s a detailed breakdown of each sentence from a **campus placement** or **competitive exam** perspective, with explanation of **errors, grammar rules involved, and correct options**:

---

### **41. This is one of the most important inventions of this century.**

**Given options:**

* invention of this century ❌
* invention of these century ❌
* invention of centuries ❌
* invention of the centuries ❌
* **No correction required ✅**

✅ **Correct Answer: Option: No correction required**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* "One of the most important inventions" — this part is correct: “inventions” is plural because it refers to a group of things.
* “of this century” — refers to **the 21st century**, which is singular and correct.

❌ Common Mistakes:

* “these century” is incorrect — “these” goes with plural nouns, but “century” is singular.
* “invention” (singular) mismatches with “one of the most important” (which needs plural).

---

### **42. The orator had been left the auditorium before the audience stood up.**

**Given options:**

* had been leaving ❌
* was left ❌
* **had left ✅**
* would leave ❌
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: Option: had left**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* "Had been left" is passive voice and incorrect here. It sounds like **someone abandoned the orator**, which is not the meaning.

🧠 **Explanation:**

* The sentence is a **question tag**.
* Main sentence: “He dislikes...” → Present simple tense → use **“doesn't he”**
* Rule:

  * Positive sentence → Negative tag
  * Use the auxiliary of the main verb ("dislikes" → present simple → "does" → "doesn't he")

---

Here is the **correct answer and explanation** for each of the grammar correction questions (Q.46 to Q.50), suitable for **campus placement exams**, **competitive exams**, or **English proficiency tests**:

---

### **46. It was unanimously resolved that the parties should unitedly undertook launching of popular programmes.**

**Options:**

* should be united undertook ❌
* should be unitedly undertaken ❌
* should be unitedly undertake ❌
* ✅ **should unitedly undertake**
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `should unitedly undertake`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* After **"should"**, we use **base verb (V1)** → "undertake" ✅
* “undertook” is past tense (V2) ❌
* “undertaken” is past participle (V3) ❌
* “should unitedly undertake” = correct verb usage
* Also, **"unitedly"** is an appropriate adverb here.

---

### **47. They continued to work in the field despite of the heavy rains.**

**Options:**

* even though there is heavy rain ❌
* although heavily rains ❌
* in spite the heavy rains ❌
* ✅ **even though it rained heavily**
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `even though it rained heavily`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* ❌ "Despite of" is incorrect. Use either:

  * **despite + noun** ✅ e.g. *despite the rain*
  * **in spite of + noun** ✅
* Correct alternative is: **"even though it rained heavily"**, which maintains meaning and fixes the grammatical error.

---

### **48. It is always better to make people realise the importance of discipline than to impose them on it.**

**Options:**

* impose it with them ❌
* impose them with it ❌
* imposing them on it ❌
* ✅ **impose it on them**
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `impose it on them`**

**Options:**

* would have been doing ❌
* would have done ❌
* had been done ❌
* ✅ **had been doing**
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `had been doing`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* "The kind of work I **had been doing** before" — past perfect continuous is correct here because:

  * It describes **an ongoing past activity before another past event (recovery)**.
* "Would be doing" is wrong because it implies **future-in-past**, not a past habitual action.

---

### **50. Later he became unpopular because he tried to lord it on his followers.**

**Options:**

* to lord it for ❌
* to lord over ❌
* ✅ **to lord it over**

✅ **Correct Answer: `to lord it over`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* The correct phrasal verb is: **“lord it over someone”**, meaning **to act superior**.
* "On his followers" is incorrect usage.
* ❌ “to lord it on”, “to lord over” – both incorrect/incomplete idioms.

### **51. The crops are dying; it must not had rained.**

**Options:**

* must had not ❌
* must not be ❌
* ✅ **must not have**
* must not have been ❌
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `must not have`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* ❌ “must not had” is **wrong tense**

---

### **52. The courts are actively to safeguard the interests and the rights of the poor.**

**Options:**

* are actively to safeguarding ❌
* ✅ **have been actively safeguarding**
* have to active in safeguarding ❌
* are actively in safeguarding ❌
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `have been actively safeguarding`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* "Are actively to safeguard" is grammatically incorrect.
* **"Have been actively safeguarding"** = present perfect continuous, correct for an ongoing action.
* Matches with “The courts” (plural subject) and ongoing responsibility.

---

**Options:**

* ✅ **No correction required**

✅ **Correct Answer: `No correction required`**

**Options:**

* have the sun rose ❌
* ✅ **had the sun risen**
* did the sun rose ❌
* the sun rose ❌
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `had the sun risen`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* The structure **“Hardly...when…”** needs **past perfect** before **“when”** clause.
* Correct form: **“Hardly had the sun risen when the stars disappeared.”**
* ❌ "does" is present; but “disappeared” is past → **tense mismatch**

---

### **55. You will be late if you do not leave now**

**Options:**

* did not leave ❌
* left ❌
* will not leave ❌
* do not happen to leave ❌
* ✅ **No correction required**

### **61. One of my drawbacks is that I do not have to tolerance of ambiguity.**

**Options:**

* ✅ **do not have**
* cannot have ❌
* am not ❌
* did not have to ❌
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `do not have`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* The phrase “have to tolerance” is **grammatically wrong** because:

  * “to” is not needed before a noun.
  * Correct form is: **“do not have tolerance”**
* “Tolerance” is an uncountable noun here, no article "the" is needed before it.

**Correct sentence:**
*One of my drawbacks is that I **do not have tolerance** of ambiguity.*

---

### **62. They should have calmly thought of the advantages that would accrue to them.**

**Options:**

* should have been calm in thinking about ❌
* should be calmly thought of ❌
* shall have to calmly thought of ❌
* should have calmly think of ❌
* ✅ **No correction required**

✅ **Correct Answer: `No correction required`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* “Should have thought of” is the correct **perfect modal** usage.
* “Calmly” is the correct adverb placed appropriately.

---

### **63. The easiest of the thing to do is to ask the address to the postman.**

**Options:**

* ✅ **of the things to do**
* among the things did ❌
* of the thing to be done ❌
* of all the things done ❌
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `of the things to do`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* “Thing” should be plural: “things” because you are choosing **one among many**.
* "Ask the address to the postman" is **also awkward**, but not part of the correction. A better version would be:
  *ask the **postman** for the address.*

**Corrected sentence (ideally):**
*The easiest **of the things to do** is to ask the **postman for the address.***

---

### **64. We demonstrated to them how we were prepared the artistic patterns.**

**Options:**

* are prepared ❌
* have prepared ❌
* are preparing ❌
* ✅ **had prepared**
* No correction required ❌

✅ **Correct Answer: `had prepared`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* The sentence describes an action **completed before** the demonstration.
* Hence, use **past perfect**: “had prepared”.
* "Were prepared" is passive and **wrong** here with “how we…”

**Correct sentence:**
*We demonstrated to them how we **had prepared** the artistic patterns.*

---

### **65. Because of his mastery in this field, his suggestions are wide accepted.**

**Options:**

* ✅ **are widely accepted**

✅ **Correct Answer: `are widely accepted`**

🧠 **Explanation:**

* “Wide” is adjective → wrong here.

* “are accepted” = correct passive voice.
  → needs adverb, not adjective.

**Correct sentence:**
*Because of his mastery in this field, his suggestions **are widely accepted**.*

| 61   | do not have            | “have to tolerance” is wrong — should be “do not have tolerance”       |
