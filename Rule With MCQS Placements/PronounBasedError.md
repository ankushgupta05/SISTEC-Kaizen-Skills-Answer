| 8   | Let’s us go for a walk.                               | **Let’s** go for a walk.                               | "Let’s" already includes “us” → don’t repeat.                          |
| 9   | That is the student **whose** pen I borrowed.         | ✅ Correct as is.                                       | "Whose" shows possession → valid here.                                 |
| 10  | The car, **that** was parked outside, belongs to him. | The car, **which** was parked outside, belongs to him. | In non-restrictive clauses (with commas), use **which**, not **that**. |
