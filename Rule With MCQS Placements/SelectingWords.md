The correct sentence is:

> I hate sitting **beside** him as he always smells of garlic.

---

### ❓ Why **not** "besides"?

* **Besides** (with **s**) means:

  * *"in addition to"*
  * Example: "Besides garlic, he eats onions too."

  This is about **adding information**, **not** physical position.

---

### ✅ Why "beside"?

* **Beside** (without **s**) means:

  * *"next to" or "at the side of"*
  * Example: "She sat beside her friend."

So:

> ✅ I hate sitting **beside** him → correct (means sitting next to him)
