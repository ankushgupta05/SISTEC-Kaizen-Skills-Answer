Let's break down each question with the **correct answer**, **explanation**, and the **grammar rule**.

---

### ✅ **6. I listened, but I had no idea what he was ...... about.**

> **Correct Answer: talking**

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* The correct phrasal structure is **"talking about"**.
* We say:

  * ❌ saying about
  * ❌ telling about
  * ❌ discussing about
  * ✅ talking about

#### 📘 Grammar Rule:

* **"talk about"** = to discuss a topic in general.

  * ✅ "He was talking about politics."
* **"say"** is used with direct speech or statements:

  * ✅ "He said that he was tired."
* **"tell"** is used with an object (person):

  * ✅ "He told me a story."
* **"discuss"** is **not** followed by "about":

  * ✅ "They discussed the issue."
  * ❌ "They discussed about the issue."

### ✅ **The car in which the minister was traveling ...... with an accident.**

> **Correct Answer: met**

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* In formal or Indian English usage, we say:

  * ✅ "met with an accident" = experienced an accident.

#### 📘 Grammar Rule:

* **"met with an accident"** is a **collocation** – a natural combination of words.

  * You can **meet with trouble**, **meet with success**, or **meet with an accident**.
* ❌ "crashed with an accident" → incorrect expression.
* ❌ "hit with an accident" → awkward phrasing.
* ❌ "drove with an accident" → meaningless.

### ✅ **29. Sonika is quite intelligent but rather ......**

> **Correct Answer: lazy**

#### 🔍 Explanation:

* The sentence creates a **contrast** using "**but**".
* "**quite intelligent**" is positive, so after "**but**" we need a **negative** trait to show contrast.
* Among options:

  * ❌ idealistic – neutral/positive
  * ❌ generous – positive
  * ❌ optimistic – positive
  * ✅ lazy – **negative**

#### 📘 Grammar Rule:

* When using **"but"** between adjectives, we usually contrast:

  * ✅ "He's rich but selfish."
  * ✅ "She's smart but rude."
  * ✅ "Sonika is quite intelligent but rather lazy."

The correct sentence is:

> I hate sitting **beside** him as he always smells of garlic.

---

### ❓ Why **not** "besides"?

* **Besides** (with **s**) means:

  * *"in addition to"*
  * Example: "Besides garlic, he eats onions too."

  This is about **adding information**, **not** physical position.

---

### ✅ Why "beside"?

* **Beside** (without **s**) means:

  * *"next to" or "at the side of"*
  * Example: "She sat beside her friend."

So:

> ✅ I hate sitting **beside** him → correct (means sitting next to him)
