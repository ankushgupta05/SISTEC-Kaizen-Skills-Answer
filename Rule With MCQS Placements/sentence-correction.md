Sure! Here's a detailed explanation for **why each sentence causes an error** and **how the correct option fixes it**, categorized properly:

---

### ✅ **Category 1: Tense Errors**

1. **He was knowing that she had left the city long ago.**
   ❌ *Error:* "was knowing" is incorrect — **'know' is a stative verb** and doesn't take continuous form.
   ✅ *Fix:* **"He knew"** is correct.

2. **If he would have studied, he would have passed.**
   ❌ *Error:* Using **"would have" in both clauses** is incorrect in conditional sentences.
   ✅ *Fix:* The correct structure is: **If + past perfect**, **would have + V3** → *If he **had studied**...*

3. **I am living here since 2010.**
   ❌ *Error:* "Since" refers to a point in time, so **perfect continuous tense** should be used.
   ✅ *Fix:* **I have been living here since 2010.**

4. **She has went to the office already.**
   ❌ *Error:* "has" requires **past participle** → "went" is past tense, not participle.
   ✅ *Fix:* **has gone** (gone = past participle)

5. **By the time you arrive, we will leave.**
   ❌ *Error:* "will leave" suggests future simple, but we’re referring to **an action completed before another future action.**
   ✅ *Fix:* **will have left** (future perfect tense)

### ✅ **Category 2: Subject-Verb Agreement**

1. **Neither of the students have completed...**
   ❌ *Error:* "Neither" is **singular**, so the verb must also be singular.
   ✅ *Fix:* **has completed**

2. **The list of items are on the table.**
   ❌ *Error:* Subject is "list" (singular), not "items".
   ✅ *Fix:* **is on the table**

3. **Each of the boys are doing...**
   ❌ *Error:* "Each" is singular.
   ✅ *Fix:* **is doing**

4. **The quality of the fruits are not good.**
   ❌ *Error:* Subject is "quality", which is singular.
   ✅ *Fix:* **is not good**

5. **A bouquet of flowers make the room look fresh.**
   ❌ *Error:* "Bouquet" is a **collective noun** and is singular here.
   ✅ *Fix:* **makes**

1. **He is good in Mathematics.**
   ❌ *Error:* The correct collocation is **"good at"** something.
   ✅ *Fix:* **good at Mathematics**

2. **She insisted to go...**
   ❌ *Error:* "insist" takes **‘on + gerund’** structure.
   ✅ *Fix:* **insisted on going**

3. **He was accused for stealing...**
   ❌ *Error:* "accused of" is the correct preposition.
   ✅ *Fix:* **accused of stealing**

### ✅ **Category 4: Pronoun/Relative Clause Errors**

1. **This is the boy who I met...**
   ❌ *Error:* "who" is a subject pronoun; here we need an object.
   ✅ *Fix:* **whom I met**

2. **He is one of those players who has never failed.**
   ❌ *Error:* "who" refers to **players** (plural), not "one".
   ✅ *Fix:* **who have never failed**

3. **It is I who is to blame.**
   ❌ *Error:* "who" refers to "I", so verb must match "I".
   ✅ *Fix:* **who am**

4. **The man which you saw\...**
   ❌ *Error:* "which" is used for things, not people.
   ✅ *Fix:* **whom you saw**

5. **This is between you and I.**
   ❌ *Error:* "I" is subject form; after a preposition like "between", we use object form.
   ✅ *Fix:* **you and me**

---

### ✅ **Category 5: Modifier & Word Order Errors**

1. **Hardly had he reached the station when the train left.**
   ❌ *Error:* After "Hardly", the correct pair is **"than"**, not "when".
   ✅ *Fix:* **Hardly... than the train left**

2. **She only speaks French at work.**
   ❌ *Error:* "only" is misplaced; it sounds like she doesn't speak at home.
   ✅ *Fix:* **She speaks only French** (emphasizes language, not place)

3. **Being a holiday, the office was closed by him.**
   ❌ *Error:* Misplaced modifier — "Being a holiday" wrongly modifies "the office".
