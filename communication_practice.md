```
Good morning!
Today I woke up early at 6 oâ€™clock. After that, I cleaned my room. Then I took a bath and did worship. During the worship, I prayed to God that everyone stays happy and healthy. I also prayed for my family, that we all stay happy. If we made any mistakes, I asked God to forgive us.

After the worship, I went to the kitchen and boiled some milk. These days I am living alone, so I thought I should buy some bread to eat. I went to the shop, bought a packet of bread, and came back home. Then I ate bread with milk.
.

Then I did some practice. The topics were percentage and partnership. After that, I talked to my family in Gorakhpur on a phone call. Then I got ready for college. Before leaving, I took blessings from my parents and then went to college.
