So, I would like to describe what I did the day before yesterday. So let's start with the morning. First of all, I woke up early in the morning, and after that, I cleaned my house. Then I took a bath and did worship. During the worship, I prayed to God that all people in the world stay happy and healthy. I also prayed for my family—that my family also stays good and healthy. And if any mistake happens by me or by my family, then I ask God to forgive that mistake.

Then I took breakfast, and after that, one important thing I would like to share with you is: that day was 6th July 2025. On that day, I had booked a ticket for my family—my mother and my elder brother. The timing of the train was 5 o’clock in the evening. 5 o'clock was the departure time of the train. My family had reached the station earlier, before 5 o’clock, but for some reason, the train was delayed by 12 hours. So for 12 hours, my family was standing at Gorakhpur station.

After completing those 12 hours, again we heard that the train was delayed by another 12 hours. So my family again spent time at the station. After completing another 12 hours, the train was again delayed by a few more hours. So I suggested to my family that they should sit in another train. At that time, it was 4 in the evening. After that, my family sat in the Kushinagar train, and they were coming to Bhopal. They reached Bhopal the next morning at 11 o’clock.

So I prayed to God that everything should go properly, and I prayed to God that someone should be sent near my family to help them—and that the person would help my family.

### routine of everyday

Good morning!
Today I woke up early at 6 o’clock. After that, I cleaned my room. Then I took a bath and did worship. During the worship, I prayed to God that everyone stays happy and healthy. I also prayed for my family, that we all stay happy. If we made any mistakes, I asked God to forgive us.

After the worship, I went to the kitchen and boiled some milk. These days I am living alone, so I thought I should buy some bread to eat. I went to the shop, bought a packet of bread, and came back home. Then I ate bread with milk.
.

Then I did some practice. The topics were percentage and partnership. After that, I talked to my family in Gorakhpur on a phone call. Then I got ready for college. Before leaving, I took blessings from my parents and then went to college.

### incident topic
---

Good morning to all. My name is Ankush Gupta. Today, I would like to share an incident — an incident that I will remember for every moment, every minute, every hour, and in every scenario of my life.

So let me start.

Just yesterday, I became a victim of fraud. I wanted to book a railway ticket on the Tatkal window. Usually, I use the IRCTC app to book tickets, but this time I was looking for an agent because, as we all know, when an agent books a Tatkal ticket, there is almost a 100% chance that the ticket gets confirmed.

So, I joined a group — or a channel — on Telegram. At that time, I received a message. That message was from someone who had written something like:
"Do you want to book your railway ticket on Tatkal?"

Coincidentally, I also wanted to book a Tatkal ticket for my family from Gorakhpur to Bhopal. At that moment, I didn’t book the ticket, but after a few days, I messaged him and asked,
"Can you book the ticket?"

The person replied,
"Yes, I can and I will book your ticket."

Then he gave me a WhatsApp number. I sent the passenger details to that number. After that, he sent me a QR code for the ticket amount. I scanned the QR code and paid him. He told me,
"Tomorrow morning at 11 o’clock, I will book your Tatkal ticket."

I trusted him.

The next day, at 12 o’clock, I messaged and called him to ask for the ticket. But he didn’t respond. He didn’t pick up the call, didn’t reply to my messages — and most importantly, he didn’t return my money.

It was at that point I realized,
I had been a victim of fraud.





So, that day was a very bad day for me.
Last night, I asked a question to PNB Sir and Ma’am. The question was:
"Ma’am, can we find out the details of a person using a UPI ID?"

Today morning, Ma’am said,
"No, we cannot find out the details of a person just by using a UPI ID."

After half an hour, Sir messaged me and also called me. He asked,
"What happened with you?"
I told him everything. Sir suggested,
"You should call the helpline number of PNB Bank."

After that, I called the PNB helpline. A Ma’am picked up the call and asked me about the issue. I explained the whole incident to her — everything that had happened with me. She then registered the account number of the fraudster and suggested:
"Go to your nearest police station and register an FIR against the person who committed fraud with you."

So, I went to the police station. There, a constable guided me and said,
"These are the documents you need to carry and submit while filing the complaint."

So, I came back home and decided that on 5th June, I will go to the police station with all the documents, submit them, and register the FIR.
