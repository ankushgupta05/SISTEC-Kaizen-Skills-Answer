👉 Shows **ownership** (something belongs to them)

## 5️⃣ **One more** (since you asked 😉) → **Then vs Than**

### **Then**

If you want, I can give you **1-line Hindi meaning**, **practice questions**, or **daily conversation examples** next 😄


Nice question 👍 This is a very common daily-life doubt.

### ✅ Rule (very simple):

* **Here is** → use with **singular** (one thing)
* **Here are** → use with **plural** (more than one)

---

## 🔹 **Here is** (ONE thing)

**Examples:**

* *Here is your book.*
* *Here is the key.*
* *Here is my phone.*

👉 One item → **is**

---

## 🔹 **Here are** (MORE than one)

**Examples:**

* *Here are your books.*
* *Here are the keys.*
* *Here are my documents.*

👉 Many items → **are**

---

## 🧠 Easy Trick

Look at the **noun after “here”**

* one → **is**
* many → **are**

---

## ❌ Common Mistake

❌ *Here is your documents*
✅ *Here are your documents*

---

### 🔥 Daily-life speaking tip

In casual spoken English, people **say “Here’s” for both**, but in **correct English (exam, office, writing)** follow the rule above.

If you want, I can also explain:

* **Here was / Here were**
* **There is / There are**
* **Exam-based questions** 😊
