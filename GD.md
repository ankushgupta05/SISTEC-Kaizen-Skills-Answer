### zero

```
Good morning everyone!
Today, I would like to talk about the topic "Zero."

According to me, zero is a very important number. It was discovered by the great Indian mathematician Aryabhata. Zero is not just a number â€” it represents a starting point. Everyone begins their journey from zero, from nothing.

In life, we all start from zero and grow step by step. It reminds us to stay humble and keep working hard. Even in technology, like in programming, indexing often starts from zero.

So, zero may look small, but it has great value. It teaches us that every big success begins with a small start.

Thank you!
