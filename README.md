AI GD Topic

"AI is a broad concept of machine learning and deep learning, where basically in AI we build a brain into the machine, and that machine takes decisions like a human."

AI refers to the capability of machines to simulate human intelligence ‚Äî learning from data, adapting to new inputs, and making decisions.

if we talk in the context of innovation:

self driving Vehicles:-
Al enables autonomous navigation, object detection, and route planning.


Assistants:-
Systems like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant understand and respond to voice.

personalized Rnendations:-
Platforms like Netflix or ‡∏ß‡∏ó use Al to it content or products


In the entire world everything Have their prawns and cons:-


Improved efficiency :-
Al automates routi and time-consuming tasks.

High Accuracy:-
Reduces human error especially in sensit fields like medicine

24/7 Availability:-
Machines can operate continuously without breaks.

saving time:-


Cost Reduction:-
Reduces long-term operational costs through




Cons of Artificial Intelligence:

imp1) :- real time data ke sath aware nahi hai.
example. :- if we say from AI that can you book my ticket from Bhopal to Gorakhpur so that AI cannot do this.

imp2) :- if we use some prompt to the chair GPT for example if I say give me basic information about the react JS so that AI chat Deputy can give me only text data not image and only give image otherwise text data so that a I cannot generate answer combination of both text and image.


Job Displacement:-
Automation may replace human jobs in many industries.

High Development Costs:-
Building reliable Al systems is expensive
and complex.


Lack of Human Emotions:-
Al cannot fully replicate human empathy and intuition.

Bias in Algorithms:-
Al systems can reflect biases from training data, leading to unfair results.
