"I would describe myself as 'versatile.' I can work with different technologies like backend, frontend, AI, and machine learning. During my engineering, I worked on many projects, did internships, and took part in hackathons to improve my skills. I always try to learn new things and apply them. I believe being versatile helps me to grow, solve problems, and stay updated in the tech world."
