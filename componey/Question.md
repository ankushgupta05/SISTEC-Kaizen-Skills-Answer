Sure 😊 Here’s your message rewritten in **simple and clear English** — without mistakes:

**Questions to Ask During the Interview:**

1. I want to know a little information about the job.
2. How many shifts are there, and what are the working hours in your organization?
3. If I get selected today or in the future and start working here, will there be any growth opportunities for me?
4. I think you have understood my level of communication.
5. It shouldn’t happen that I work for 15 days, and then the company suddenly says that my job is suspended or terminated for some reason.
6. Do you provide any casual leaves (CL), and is it possible to take urgent leave if needed?
7. Is there any specific time or month when your company starts the hiring process?

Would you like me to make this sound **more professional** (like for an interview), or keep it **simple and polite** like this version?





ठीक है भाई, अब इसे simple English version में बना देता हूँ, जिसे आप phone पर naturally बोल सको।

Simple Phone Script (English)

1. Stipend / Salary



“Sir/Ma’am, may I know what the stipend will be for this role?”


2. Location / Address



“Could you please tell me the full office address?”

“Or will it be work from home?”


3. Assessment / Interview



“Will there be any further assessment or interview?”


4. Timeline / Offer Letter

5. Joining Date



“What will be the expected joining date?”

Ye version polite, simple aur easy to remember hai.

Agar चाहो तो मैं इसे 1–2 minute natural conversation version bhi bana du, jise aap phone pe directly bol sako without reading. Chahoge mai bana du?
