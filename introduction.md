Self-Introduction (for Campus Placement)

> Good morning Sir/Madam,

First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
My name is Ankush Gupta, and I’m from Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh.
I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Sagar Institute of Science and Technology (SISTec GN).

I’m passionate about full-stack web development and have hands-on experience with technologies like Python, Django, React, Next.js, and machine learning frameworks.
Recently, I worked on an AI-based mock interview platform named Interview-Sathi, where I contributed to full-stack development, real-time interview flow, and LLM-based question generation.

In another project, Eye Disease Classification System, I developed a CNN-powered tool for diagnosing cataracts and glaucoma via image analysis.

My strengths are that I am self-motivated, disciplined, and always eager to learn.
My short-term goal is to gain a position where I can apply my technical skills and grow professionally.

Apart from coding, I enjoy playing chess and cricket, which help me improve my focus and strategic thinking.

That's all about me. Thank you for your time!
