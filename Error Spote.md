🔹 What Are Transitive Verbs?

A transitive verb needs a direct object to complete its meaning.

🟢 Example:

✅ She bought a dress.
(“a dress” = object of the verb bought)


🔴 Incorrect:

❌ She bought.



---

🔹 What Are Intransitive Verbs?

An intransitive verb does not need an object.

🟢 Example:

✅ He slept peacefully.
(No object needed)


🔴 Incorrect:

❌ He slept the bed.



---

✅ Common Transitive Verbs (Need an Object):

Verb	Example

enjoy	I enjoyed the movie.
need	We need your help.
tell	He told a story.
ask	She asked a question.
complete	I completed the project.
invite	They invited us.
discuss	We discussed the plan.
attend	He attended the meeting.



---

🚫 Common Errors in Placement Questions

Here are typical error spotting patterns in placement exams:


---

🧠 1. Missing Object with a Transitive Verb

❌ She discussed about the issue.
✅ She discussed the issue.

Explanation: "discuss" is a transitive verb, so it doesn't need 'about'.


---

🧠 2. Wrong Preposition or Reflexive Pronoun

❌ They enjoyed at the wedding.
✅ They enjoyed themselves at the wedding.

Explanation: "enjoy" needs a direct object (themselves here).


---

🧠 3. Using Object with Intransitive Verbs

❌ He slept the bed.
✅ He slept on the bed.

Explanation: "slept" is intransitive — doesn’t take a direct object.


---

🧠 4. Confusing Verbs That Can Be Both

Some verbs can be both transitive and intransitive, depending on usage:

Verb	Transitive	Intransitive

run	He ran a company.	He ran fast.
change	She changed her dress.	The weather changed.
grow	They grew flowers.	He grew quickly.



---

📘 Practice Question Examples:

Q1. The teacher explained the students the topic.
➡️ Error: explained the students
✅ Correction: explained the topic to the students
(“explain” takes object + to when the indirect object comes first.)


---

Q2. He returned back the money.
➡️ Error: returned back (redundant)
✅ Correction: returned the money
("Returned" already means "back", no need to repeat)


---

Q3. The baby cried loudly for milk.
✅ No error. ("cry" is intransitive)


---

📌 Quick Tip to Identify:

If you can ask "what?" or "whom?" after the verb and get an answer — it’s transitive.


---























---

Question 1:

While climbing the mountain,
the bag slipped and
rolled down the slope.
No error.
A / B / C / D

✅ Answer: A
Explanation:
"While climbing the mountain" is a dangling modifier — who was climbing? Clarify it:
👉 "While he was climbing the mountain..."


---

Question 2:

Neither of the boys
have submitted
their assignments yet.
No error.
A / B / C / D

✅ Answer: B

---

Question 3:

Each of the players
are required to attend
the practice session.
No error.
A / B / C / D

✅ Answer: B

---

Question 4:

She not only danced gracefully
but also sang
beautifully on the stage.
No error.
A / B / C / D

---

Question 5:

Despite of being tired,
he continued
working late at night.
No error.
A / B / C / D

---

Question 6:

He is one of those students
who always try
to do their best.
No error.
A / B / C / D

is more interesting
than the one I bought yesterday.
No error.

---

Question 8:

to the hotel
after the game.

---

Question 9:

He has completed
his graduation
from Delhi University.
No error.
A / B / C / D

✅ Answer: B
Explanation:
"Graduation" is a noun, and the correct verb is graduated, not "completed graduation".

---

Question 10:

Having finished the assignment,
the TV was switched on
for some relaxation.
No error.
A / B / C / D
