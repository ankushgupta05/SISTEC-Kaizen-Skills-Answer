Yes, I recently worked on Interview Sathi, an AI-powered interview preparation platform.
It allows users to select their interview domain, upload their resume, and take a mock interview. Afterward, the system provides detailed feedback and improvement suggestions. The goal is to help candidates build confidence and perform better in real interviews."



Question: Why did you choose this project?

Answer:
I chose Interview Sathi because I noticed many people find interviews challenging, even if they have good skills. I wanted to create a platform that uses AI to help them practice, get feedback, and feel more confident before real interviews.





Question: What problem did you face during the project?

Answer:
During the project, we didn’t face any major technical issues, but one challenge was to clearly understand how to connect all the parts like AI question generation, voice input, and feedback system in a smooth way. With regular team discussions and research, we were able to plan and implement everything step by step





Question: How is your solution different from others?

Answer:
In comparison to many other platforms that just show fixed questions or give basic comments, Interview Sathi offers a complete and realistic mock interview. It understands your voice, replies like a real interviewer using AI, and gives detailed feedback based on your answers. This feedback is customized for each user — it points out your strengths and the exact areas where you can improve. So it feels like real interview practice, not just question and answer.




Question: What did you learn from this project?

Answer:
On the technical side, I learned how to build an AI-based system that generates interview questions based on job roles and understands user responses. I used WebSocket for real-time interaction, added speech-to-text and text-to-speech features to handle voice input and output, and worked on reading useful information from PDF files like resumes and job descriptions. I also learned how to connect the frontend and backend properly to make the whole system work smoothly.

On the soft skills side, I improved my teamwork, time management, and communication. The project taught me how to work well with a team and solve problems in an organized way.





Question: What would you improve if given more time?

Answer:
we would continue working on this as our final project. We plan to add features like live video interviews, video recording, and video-based feedback. This would make the experience more realistic and help users improve their body language and eye contact along with their answers.
