## 🙋‍♂️ Introduction
**Good morning Sir/Madam,**

First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.  
My name is **Ankush Gupta**, and I’m from **Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh**.  

I am currently pursuing **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** from **Sagar Institute of Science and Technology (SISTec GN)**.  

I’m passionate about **full-stack web development** and have hands-on experience with technologies like **Python, Django, DRF, Node.js, JavaScript, React**, and **machine learning & deep learning frameworks**.  

Recently, I worked on an **AI-based mock interview platform named Interview-Sathi**, where I contributed to full-stack development, real-time interview flow, and **LLM-based question generation**.  

I also completed a **4-month internship at SkillQuest Learnings as a Software Intern**, where I worked on impactful projects and gained practical experience in full-stack development within a professional team environment.  

My strengths are that I am **self-motivated, disciplined, and always eager to learn**.  
My short-term goal is to gain a position where I can apply my technical skills and grow professionally.  

Apart from coding, I enjoy **playing chess and cricket**, which help me improve my focus and strategic thinking.  

**That’s all about me. Thank you for your time!**
