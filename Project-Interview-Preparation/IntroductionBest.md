**Good morning Sir/Madam,**

First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
My name is **Ankush Gupta**, and I’m from **Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh**.

I am currently pursuing **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** from **Sagar Institute of Science and Technology (SISTec GN)**.

I’m passionate about **full-stack web development** and have hands-on experience with technologies like **Python, Django, DRF, Node.js, JavaScript, React**, and have strong fundamental knowledge in **Machine Learning (NumPy, Pandas) and Deep Learning frameworks**.

In development, I also have knowledge of **Docker, AWS, Git, and GitHub** for collaboration.

Recently, I worked on an **AI-based mock interview platform named Interview-Sathi**, where I contributed to **full-stack development**, implementing **real-time interaction using WebSocket**, **speech-to-text and text-to-speech features** for voice input/output, and **extracting useful information from PDF files (resumes and job descriptions)**. Through this, I gained strong practical skills in **AI integration, real-time systems, and full-stack development**.

My second project was the **Eye-Disease Classification System**, a web-based platform designed to detect common eye conditions such as **cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma**. Users can upload their **eye images** or describe symptoms to receive an initial health check with clear guidance. The system uses an **advanced CNN deep learning model** for accurate early detection. I was the **Team Leader of four members**. Through this project, I built strong fundamentals in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and data handling with NumPy and Pandas**.

I also completed a **4-month internship at SkillQuest Learnings** as a **Software Intern**, where I worked on impactful projects. Throughout the internship, I worked with **Node.js and React**, gained some knowledge of **unit testing**, and developed **practical experience in full-stack development within a professional team environment**.

My strengths are that I am **self-motivated, disciplined, and always eager to learn**.

That’s all about me. **Thank you for your time!**
