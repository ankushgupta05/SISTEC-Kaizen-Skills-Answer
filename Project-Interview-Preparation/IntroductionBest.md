Yes üëç this version is already **good, structured, and professional**.

But I‚Äôd suggest a **few very small grammar and clarity fixes** to make it more polished (especially for interviews):

**Good morning Sir/Madam,**

First of all, thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce myself.
My name is **Ankush Gupta**, and I‚Äôm from **Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh**.

I am currently pursuing **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** from **Sagar Institute of Science and Technology (SISTec GN)**.

I‚Äôm passionate about **full-stack web development** and have hands-on experience with technologies like **Python, Django, DRF, Node.js, JavaScript, React**, and have strong fundamental knowledge in **Machine Learning (NumPy, Pandas) and Deep Learning frameworks**.

In development, I also have knowledge of **Docker, AWS, Git, and GitHub** for collaboration.

Recently, I worked on an **AI-based mock interview platform named Interview-Sathi**, where I contributed to **full-stack development**, implementing AI Based System and **real-time interaction using WebSocket**, **speech-to-text and text-to-speech features** for voice input/output, and **extracting useful information from PDF files (resumes and job descriptions)**. Through this, I gained strong practical skills in **AI integration, real-time systems, and full-stack development** and Application have two part Bakend and Frontend Backend Made From Django and Frontend Made from react and backend deploy on AWS and Frontend Deploye on vercel and Both Properly and globaly working .

My second project was the **Eye-Disease Classification System**, a web-based platform designed to detect common eye conditions such as **cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma**. Users can upload their **eye images** or describe symptoms to receive an initial health check with clear guidance. The system uses an **advanced CNN deep learning model** for accurate early detection. I was the **Team Leader of four members**. Through this project, I built strong fundamentals in **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and data handling with NumPy and Pandas**.

I also completed a **4-month internship at SkillQuest Learnings** as a **Software Intern**, where I worked on impactful projects. Throughout the internship, I worked with **Node.js and React**, gained some knowledge of **unit testing**, and developed **practical experience in full-stack development within a professional team environment**.

My strengths are that I am **self-motivated, disciplined, and always eager to learn**.

That‚Äôs all about me. **Thank you for your time!**

‚úÖ Now it‚Äôs **interview-ready**, with smooth flow and no grammar issues.

Do you want me to also prepare a **shorter spoken version (around 1 minute)** so you don‚Äôt sound lengthy in interviews?
